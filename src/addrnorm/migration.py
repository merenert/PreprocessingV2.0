    üìã MIGRATION GUIDE: Complex Parser ‚Üí Simple Text Processing
    =========================================================

    OLD CODE (Complex explanation parser):
    -------------------------------------
    from addrnorm.explanation import ExplanationParser

    parser = ExplanationParser()
    result = parser.parse("Migros yanƒ±")
    print(result.landmark.name)  # "Migros"
    print(result.relation.relation)  # "yanƒ±"
    print(result.confidence)  # 0.92


    NEW CODE (Simple text processing):
    ---------------------------------
    from addrnorm.explanation import process_explanation

    cleaned = process_explanation("Migros yanƒ±")
    print(cleaned)  # "Migros yanƒ±"

    # For backward compatibility:
    from addrnorm.explanation import parse_explanation
    cleaned = parse_explanation("Migros yanƒ±")  # Same as process_explanation


    üéØ KEY CHANGES:
    --------------
    ‚ùå REMOVED: Landmark detection and classification
    ‚ùå REMOVED: Spatial relation extraction
    ‚ùå REMOVED: Confidence scoring and complex analysis
    ‚ùå REMOVED: Fuzzy matching and compound relations
    ‚ùå REMOVED: Performance caching and batch processing

    ‚úÖ SIMPLIFIED: Basic text cleaning and validation
    ‚úÖ FOCUSED: explanation_raw field processing only
    ‚úÖ MAINTAINED: Backward compatibility with parse_explanation()


    üí° RATIONALE:
    ------------
    The explanation module was simplified to focus on the core requirement:
    cleaning and validating text for the explanation_raw field. Complex
    landmark parsing was deemed unnecessary for the primary use case.


    ÔøΩ INTEGRATION EXAMPLE:
    ----------------------
    # Use with main address normalization
    from addrnorm import AddressNormalizer
    from addrnorm.explanation import process_explanation

    normalizer = AddressNormalizer()

    def normalize_with_explanation(address_text):
        # Clean explanation
        explanation_cleaned = process_explanation(address_text)

        # Normalize address
        result = normalizer.normalize(address_text)

        # Add cleaned explanation to result
        if isinstance(result, dict):
            result["explanation_raw"] = explanation_cleaned

        return result


    üìö RESOURCES:
    ------------
    - Simplified module docs: docs/explanation_parser.md
    - Simple tests: tests/test_explanation_simple.py
    - Main output format: src/addrnorm/utils/contracts.py
